Head over to https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ and download the LITE version. As of writing this, it is 
RASPBIAN STRETCH LITE. Extract the file with .img extension only from the compressed archieve.
Download the microSD card burner from https://etcher.io
Insert your microSD card reader/writer and burn the .img file on your microSD card.
After a successful burn & eject , remove the microSD card from the writer and insert it into Raspberry Pi and hook it up with a 
HDMI Monitor or a TV. For video demonstration, just watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDIgS8nres

Default login is "pi" and password is "raspberry"
Run raspi-config and enable ssh access on your Pi first. ( you have to use sudo there )
Read: http://www.instructables.com/id/Use-ssh-to-talk-with-your-Raspberry-Pi/
Find out the IP address of your Pi by logging into your home DSL/Fiber device. It will show as "pi".

From now on, just paste the following commands to your raspberry

# setup sudo access if required
sudo passwd 

# update packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# install dependencies
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libdb++-dev libdb-dev libboost-all-dev libqrencode-dev libminiupnpc-dev git

# clone innovaminex github
sudo git clone https://github.com/innovaminexd/source.git innovaminex

# build leveldb
cd ~/innovaminex/src/leveldb/
sudo chmod +x build_detect_platform
sudo make libleveldb.a libmemenv.a

# builds wallet and daemon for pi
cd ~/innovaminex/src/
sudo make -f makefile.unix -j2 

# reduce binary size
sudo strip innovaminexd

# copy daemon binary for system wide access (optional)
sudo mv innovaminexd /usr/bin/innovaminexd

# run it once and wait for it to give you a config missing error
innovaminexd 

# copy conf template (note: staking has already been enabled)
cd ~/.innovaminex
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/innovaminexd/releases/master/innovaminex.conf

# run the wallet or the daemon. You can check the sync progress by issuing:
innovaminexd 

# check debug
tail -f .innovaminexd/debug.log ( press Ctrl+C to cancel )

# get a wallet address
innovaminexd getnewaddress

# copy that address and send 1 INX as a test. 
# Wait for a block confirmation and it should show up after you run:
innovaminexd getbalance

# to check status and connections
innovaminexd getinfo

# to checki wallet staking
innovaminexd getstakinginfo
# make sure it says "enabled: true" and "staking: true"


# If you wish to take backup of your staking wallet or copy over your 
# current desktop wallet, use WinSCP or Filezilla client.
# Be sure to specify IP, user and password in the file transfer client. 
# Protocol should be SCP and port 22. 
# For Filezilla, use the following :

host: sftp://pi-ipaddress user: pi password:your-password port:22

# Jump to .innovaminex folder and copy the wallet.dat 
# or place your wallet backup there in that folder. 
# ( Important: Make sure you run 'innovaminexd stop' before you modify conf/wallet files

# thats pretty much it. ask devs for tips on Discord or Telegram on how to stake INX on your PI.
